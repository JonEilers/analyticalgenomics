<p>Modern DNA sequencing offers unprecedented insights into how life on this planet works. However, the volume and complexity of the sequencing data makes it difficult to manage and extract answers from. The mission of Analytical Genomics is to facilitate biology and genetics research by providing bioinformatics expertise at every step of the modern scientific experiment including; experimental design, data analysis, and interpretation. If it has DNA, RNA, or proteins and you need help with bioinformatics, we are here for you. We love all living organisms and are happy to work with data from both model and non-model organisms.</p>

		<h3>Experimental Design</h3>
		<p>It goes without saying, this is the most important part of any experiment. You want to get this right and we can help, including us at this step will ensure you get the results you want. Analytical Genomics is dedicated to providing full transparency regarding our services and how they fit within the scope of your project goals, budget, and resources. Additionally, we will gladly assist with grant writing. </p>

		<h3>Analysis</h3>
		<p>The road to learning bioinformatics is a steep one. Bringing us onto your team will let you side step that difficult and frustrating climb. We know there is not a "perfect" tool for bioinformatics and will test the plethora of tools and methods available to find the most appropriate one while ensuring effective communication with your team so there is no ambiguity regarding tools and analyses that are used and how to understand the results.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
		<h3>Interpretation</h3>
		<p>Interpreting results is fraught with caveats and dubious p-values. Our background in statistics and understanding the limitations of the analysis can save you the embarrassment of having to backtrack when someone notices you didn't use a Bonferroni correction on those p-values. We are also determined to provide only the highest quality results, interpretations, and explanations. We won't drop the data and results on your computer and then ghost you. </p>
