			<h2> Bioinformatics Expertise with an Emphasis in Genomics</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Genetics sequence data is an opaque string of ATGCs in a text file. The answers to your biological questions are hidden within, but the means to get that precious information out is often either extremely expensive or requires time and resources that are inaccessible to most biologists. Analytical Genomics offers a solution; A bioinformatician dedicated to answering your questions using the latest tools, statistics, and cutting edge scientific knowledge.</p>

					<h3>Population Genetics and Phenotyping</h3>
				</header>
				<p> Population genetics offers tantalizing insights into population adaptation, evolution, and identifying gene and regulatory elements responsible for phenotypes. But that large data and shallow sequencing comes at a cost; a need for rigorous analysis and high statistical confidence. Including Analytical Genomics expertise in your experimental design decisions will help ensure your experiment has appropriate sequencing and sampling depth. The results will allow you to confidently identify population wide changes in genetics and sequences responsible for phenotypes of interest. </p>

					<h3>Gene Expression and Epigenetics</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Differential gene expression has been the backbone of genetics research for the past decade. Recent advances in sequencing technology has offered unparalleled insights into cell specific gene expression, chromatin conformation, and epigenetic modifications. These data can be combined to achieve a comprehensive view of whats happening at a tissue and cell level. However, this requires intimate knowledge of multiple sequencing technologies, bioinformatic tools, and statistical analyses. Analytical Genomics offers expertise in utilizing the latest methods, tools, and statistics to achieving meaningful results.</p>

			<h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
		</header>
		<p> Analytical Genomics is focused on providing a collaborative and personalized approach to our bioinformatics services. If you have a scientific question you want to explore, we will gladly help figure out how to answer it in the most scientifically rigorous way possible. We also believe that a bioinformatician is an integral part of the modern biology research team and it takes time to build that relationship. As such, we offer our services <i>pro bono</i> with experimental design, bioinformatic analysis, and results interpretation for the first collaboration. Please note, this offer is limited to small projects which are "within reason".</p>
